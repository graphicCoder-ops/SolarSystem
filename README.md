# Solar System Simulation with Three.js

Welcome to the Solar System Simulation project! This project utilizes the power of Three.js to create a visually stunning and interactive simulation of the solar system in 3D space. With realistic celestial bodies and smooth animations, users can explore and learn more about the planets and their orbits.

## Demo

## Getting Started

To run the simulation on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the simulation
npx vite
```

4. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the simulation.

## Controls

- Use your mouse to rotate the camera and navigate the 3D space.
- Zoom in and out with the scroll wheel.

## Features

- Realistic representation of the solar system.
- Smooth animations for planetary orbits.
- Interactive controls for a user-friendly experience.

## Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): A popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A fast build tool that leverages native ES Module imports.
